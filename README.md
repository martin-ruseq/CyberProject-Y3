# Python Cybercrime Data Collection and Analysis Application

This project showcases the power of Python for cybercrime data collection, analysis, and visualization. It utilizes the following tools and libraries:

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - a collection of useful tools for building data apps
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - a library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a library for data manipulation and analysis
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - a library for numerical computing in Python
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) - a graphing library for creating interactive, publication-quality graphs

The collected data is cleaned and analyzed using Pandas and NumPy, and visualized through the use of Matplotlib and Plotly. The web front end is developed using Flask, providing a user-friendly interface that allows for data filtering, sorting, and interaction with visualizations.
