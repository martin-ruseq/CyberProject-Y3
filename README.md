As part of my 3rd-year Cyber Security project, I successfully developed a Python application designed to collect cybercrime-related data from the Internet. The application has been crafted using a variety of tools, including:

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - an open-source Python library facilitating the creation and sharing of beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - a library adept at extracting data from HTML and XML files.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a versatile library for data manipulation and analysis.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) - a graphing library essential for crafting interactive, publication-quality graphs.
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - a library serving the purpose of making HTTP requests.
  
The application, showcased [here](https://cyber-project.streamlit.app/), elegantly presents data through charts and graphs as a web application. Having reached its completion, if you appreciate the functionality, feel free to :star: the repository and [Follow Me](https://github.com/martin-ruseq) on GitHub for future updates and additional features.
