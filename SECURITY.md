## Reporting a Vulnerability

At CyberHub, I take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue within my application, I appreciate your help in disclosing it to me responsibly.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until I have had a chance to address it.
2. **Submit a detailed report** to me by emailing [here](mailto:marcin.rusiecki@protonmail.com). Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability and the potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots that demonstrate the issue.
   - Your contact information (name, email address, and any relevant social media profiles).
3. **Allow me reasonable time** to investigate and address the vulnerability before disclosing it to others.

I am committed to responding promptly to security vulnerability reports and to providing clear communication during the resolution process.

## Guidelines

To ensure a safe and secure environment for my users, I kindly request that you adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Do not attempt to gain unauthorized access** to my systems or user accounts.
- **Do not perform any actions** that could disrupt or harm the application or its users.
- **Do not disclose, share, or exploit** any vulnerabilities to others without my prior written consent.
- **Do not compromise the privacy** or personal information of my users during your security testing.

I appreciate your cooperation in helping me maintain the security and integrity of my application. Thank you for your support!
